## Planned Commands
The following commands are planned for future implementation:

- `!xp`: Grants experience points.
- `!gamerule`: Allows modification of game rules. (not all gamerule commands)
- `!locate`: Locates a specific structure.
- `!list`: Displays a list of players in the game.
- `!seed`: Reveals the world seed.
- `!playsound`: Plays a custom sound effect.
- `!attribute`: Adjusts player or entity attributes.
- `!ride`: Causes the player to mount an entity.
- `!particle`: Generates visual particle effects.
- `!tick`: Modifies the game's tick speed.
- `!anvil`: Drops an anvil on the player.

## To-Do List
The following tasks will enhance gameplay mechanics and balance:

- **Reduce item stack size**: Adjust item drop amounts from 16 to 8.
- **Anti-spam system**: Prevent command spamming by disallowing repeated commands in succession. Players must use a different command for it to register.
- **Individual cooldowns**: Implement cooldown timers for each player instead of a global cooldown for chat.
- **Hostile mob duration**: Extend the summoning duration between hostile mobs.
- **Single-stack item duration**: Extend the give command duration for items that are single-stack.
- **Spawning Radius**: Summoning a mob will spawn them within a 5 block radius, possible in any direction, instead of on the character
