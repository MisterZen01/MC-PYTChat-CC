- **Hostile mob duration**: Extend the summoning duration between hostile mobs.
- **Single-stack item duration**: Extend the give command duration for items that are single-stack.
- **Spawning Radius**: Summoning a mob will spawn them within a 5 block radius, possible in any direction, instead of on the character
- **Reaction to YouTube**: Liking, Subscribing, Superchat, Membership, Sharing?, Clipping?
- **Face Detection Command**: Activates command due to having a certain facial reaction
- **Super Secret Settings options**: Try to impliment those settings in Minecraft (Souper Secret Settings Fabric Mod 1.21)(Make separate)

## Add more entities:

- Give the player a nametag with "Dinnerbone" and/or "Grumm" already on it
