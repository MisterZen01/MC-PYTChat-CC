Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for YouTube Crowd Control integration. These enhancements aim to expand functionality, improve user experience, and maintain balance in gameplay.

Planned Commands:
- !painting: Gives the player a specific painting (including unsused paintings)

Planned Command Changes:
- !enchant: Give enchanted book instead of enchanting the held item
- !speed <freeze>: Reinstate !freeze under the !speed command

To-Do List (Not in any particular order):
The following tasks will enhance gameplay mechanics and balance:
- Spawning Radius: Summoning a mob will spawn them within a 5-block radius in any direction instead of on the character
- Reaction to YouTube: Commands triggered by Liking, Subscribing, Superchat, Membership, Sharing, and Clipping
- Blocking: Blocks messages or replaces profanity with asterisks
- Dynamic Cooldown: Automatically adjusts cooldown time based on overuse per user
- Dynamic Difficulty: More viewers = Higher difficulty
- Command Stacking: Allows stacking commands (e.g., !move forward 5 would execute the command 5 times and multiply the cooldown accordingly)
- Easier cooldown time adjustment FROM command calls (e.g., !screenshot, screenshot_command(c.message, user))
- Universal Dictionary: Standardized global variables (e.g., user, global, cooldown, last_command, etc.)
- More complex cooldown timing: Implement global, command-specific, categorical, and subcommand cooldowns
- Ensure all commands have global user_last_command or global cooldown tracking
- Simplify Anti-Spam Check, integrate it into the commands function to call cooldown management instead of having each commands have it own Anti-Spam Check
- Add dictionaries inside functions to allow customizable commands (e.g., gravity, speed, etc.)
- Notify and Guide/Tip users when a command is incomplete
- Events: Implement limited-time or special events based on the number of current viewers
- Properties.txt: Stores a URL for the code to fetch updates or settings
- Make cooldown time optional (configurable in properties.txt)
- Make anti-spam optional (configurable in properties.txt)
- Simplify and improve command usability for users
- Make code compatible with popular modpacks

Command Ideas:
The following commands are ideas for future implementation:
- !attribute: Adjust more player or entity attributes
- !gamerule: Temporarily modifies gamerules (60sec duration, cost: 600sec)
- !motion <slow, fast>:
Slow motion: 30sec duration, cost: 60sec (reduces tick rate and tick speed)
Fast motion: 30sec duration, cost: 30sec (increases tick rate, tick speed, and movement speed)
- !damage <item>: cost: 60sec
- !heal <item>: (Repairs item) costs: 30sec
- !enchant <remove>: Removes enchants from held item, cost: 600sec
- !hunger <remove>: Removes all food from inventory, cost: 600sec
- !flip <1, all>: Applies Dinnerbone nametag effect (not visible), cost: 60 seconds
- !shuffle: Randomizes in-game language
- !lock <none, ground, sky>: Locks camera, 15sec duration (similar to !freeze but allow movement)
none: cost: 180sec
ground/sky: cost: 360sec
- !invert <camera, controls>: 30sec duration, cost: 300sec
- !sensitivity: Increas or decrease mouse sensitivity, 15sec duration, cost: 150sec
- !mouse: Combines attack, use, and pick functions
- !lookout: Teleports character into the sky 50 blocks and slow falling to prevent fall damage
- Consolidate Inventory command? <open, !drop command, scramble>

Other Ideas:
- Voting System: Allows viewers to vote on more impactful commands
- Loyalty-based Perks: Cooldown time varies based on user loyalty (Free, Subscriber, Member Tiers 1-5, Moderator, Superchat Donors, Whitelist)
- Daily Limits: Implement limits on certain commands
- Face Detection: Activates a command based on facial reactions

Needs Testing:
- Async processing and command queuing for multiple users, first-in, first-out command order

After Stream Test 3/12/25:
- 2x time for all hostile and some neutral actions 
- Add global cooldown for certain commands
- Add evoker to super_hostile category
- Fix "last_used_time" from crashing crowd control (cc.py) script
- Add fling to gravity command to prevent combo-ing
- Add !wolf fling combo (blackhole + fling)
- Add !wolf poison combo (poison + blackhole)
- Add !brain combo (blackhole + cobweb + tnt)
- Prevent cobweb from breaking bed
